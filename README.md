# mechanicalkeyboard
Arduino powered mechanical keyboard.

A full writeup along with photos is available on my [website](http://tyrelh.github.io/mechanicalkeyboard).

This is a mechanical keyboard based around a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller board and the Cherry MX switches.

The point of this project is not only to build myself a keyboard from scratch, creating a custom 65% layout, but also to try to program it myself, learning more C++ along the way.

It is custom built but should be easily adapted to a similar project using a Teensy 3.2 or equivalent microcontroller and a matrix for the keys.
