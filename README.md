Arduino powered mechanical keyboard
by Tyrel Hiebert

This is a mechanical keyboard based around a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller board and the Cherry MX switches.

The point of this project is not only to build myself a keyboard from scratch, creating a custom 65% layout, but also to try to program it myself, learning more C++ along the way.

The matrix wiring is mostly complete, need to wire the controller in still.

Began writing the basic matrix scanning code.
